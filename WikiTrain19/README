This directory contains the training data for 
MultiLing 2017 short summary generation for Wikipedia feature
articles.  

The directory "full" contains the original Wikipedia 
feature articles in an XML format. There are 42 subdirectories
one for each language and for each language there are Wikipedia
feature articles whose XML tags give the three major parts:

	1. <title>
	2. <summary>
	3. <body>

The <body> part contains one or more <section> sub parts, each of which may
have a <header> tag.  

The directory "clipped" contains the same Wikipedia feature articles;
however, the <text> portions <title> and <header> in the <body> have
been replaced with an integer, giving the length in characters of the missing text
portion of the <title> and <header>.  The text portions of each <p>
(paragraph) of the summary are also replaced with the length of the extracted
text in bytes.  The task for the MultiLing19 Wikipedia is to reconstruct the
missing text portion of the <title>.
